On January 6th, 2016 we hosted an event dedicated to the Murphy Bill: [NYC Icarus Murphy Bill Event](http://nycicarus.org/events/murphy-bill/). Since then, in the wake of the Orlando tragedy, the bill has passed congress (400-2) and is on it's way to the sentate.

Here are the pamphlets we have prepared summarizing our opposition:

Our January pamphlet, [Helping or Harming?](http://nycicarus.org/images/2016-01-murphy.pdf) (original InDesign source file for remixing: [source](http://nycicarus.org/images/2016-01-murphy.ai)).

Our updated April pamphlet, [About us, without us](http://nycicarus.org/images/2016-07-murphy.pdf) (source file coming soon!).

Stay tuned for ongoing updates.
