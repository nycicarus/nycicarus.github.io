### JEREMY P. ORTMAN, LMHC

#### Get to know me
I am a New York State Licensed Mental Health Counselor. In addition to my private practice, I serve as an adjunct faculty member at Columbia University, Teachers College.  Formerly, I oversaw the Mental Health and Substance Abuse Counseling department at the HIV/AIDS organization, GMHC.  I earned an advanced Masterâ€™s Degree in Counseling Psychology from Columbia University, Teachers College and a Bachelor's Degree from Brandeis University. 

My approach to counseling is informed by multiple schools of thought including Psychodynamic Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Attachment Theory, and Relational Psychotherapy. Integrating these philosophies enhances my ability to adapt to the unique needs of each individual, family, or group that I work with.

My commitment to professional development is reflected in my pursuits in mindfulness, personal narrative writing, EMDR, and creative arts therapy, all of which I incorporate into my practice.  I am inspired by film, music, poetry, and pop culture and often utilize aspects of these and other art forms as reference points in my therapeutic work. I have extensive experience working with creative professionals, the LGBTQ community, and stressed out New Yorkers of all kinds.
