### NYC Icarus - Open Mad Night: A Share and Tell Of Madness and Self Expression

#### Join us at Bluestockings May 4th, 7pm for a showcase of mad art in words, song, pictures and more

Open Mad Night: A Share and Tell Of Madness and Self Expression

"Practicing an art  is a way to make your soul grow. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. ...You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something.‚Äù
- Kurt Vonnegut Jr.  

Art has been a powerful therapeutic tool  for many people who have gone through emotional crises. We at Icarus would like to invite you to share your creativity with us. 

On May 4th at 7pm  at the Bluestockings Bookstore and Activist Center we will open the floor for sharing of: visual art, poems, theatre pieces, songs, stories or even just a chance to talk about madness and how it relates to you. 

If you are interested in sharing and would like a spot on the list  please email Icarus organizer Josh Krieble at propellerproject@gmail.com

Shares are encouraged to be within the time range of 3-5 minutes. Internet access and a projection screen will be provided if any music or multimedia support is needed. 
Hope to see you there!

All NYC Icarus events try to create a space for [Mad Making](http://nycicarus.org/events/madmaking/) - where community members can self-organize their own peer-support groups.
