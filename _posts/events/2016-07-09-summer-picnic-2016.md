### NYC Icarus - Annual Mad Summer Picnic

#### Join us on July 9th, 3pm 

Friends make the best casserole!

Join the Icarus community, where friends make the best medicine (and casserole), for a potluck picnic of mad solidarity, community building, and fun! 

Psychiatric consumers, survivors, ex patients, peer counselors, neurodivergent people, present or potential mad allies in feminist, anti-racist, disability rights, anti-capitalist, LGBTQ+, anti-colonialist, and other social justice movements; students, and professionals.

Let's come together and start to collaborate! We can do more together than apart! And let's have some fun! Hope to see you there!

We will be meeting in a more seculded location away from the fountain. Look for us.
The park is wheelchair assessible.
