### Lived Through That: An Open Mic Celebrating Survival in 2016 

#### Join us at Bluestockings on February 1st, 7pm for our second annual peer-support mixer

It’s 2017, we’re living through some dark and fearful times, and as we struggle to navigate this brave new world many of us are looking to our communities for some extra strength and support. Join us for our second annual Peer Support Mixer, where we will come together to meet one another and brainstorm ways to take care of each other even in extreme emotional and political crises. Folks who formed a group at the last mixer will reflect on their experiences with what has and hasn’t worked over the past year. We will share basic tools and facilitation techniques for holding an Icarus-style support meeting and distribute information about other organizations and networks in NYC that offer alternative forms of support. We will mingle and get to know each other by practicing meeting in small groups, and participants will walk away with the tools to start their own groups and hopefully some new like- minded friends who want to work together to build a thriving community support network in NYC. 

*If you know of a group that offers some form of peer support that you would like us to plug at this event, please write to us at nycicarus@gmail.com.
