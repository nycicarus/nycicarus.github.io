### NYC Icarus - Film and Discussion with Filmmaker: Daniel Mackler's "Coming Off Psych Drugs"

#### Join us at Bluestockings March 2nd, 7pm for a viewing and discussion of withdrawl.

This month NYC Icarus and filmmaker Daniel Mackler will host a screening and  discussion about withdrawl on March 2nd at 7pm at the Bluestockings Bookstore and Activist Center.  A question and answer session will promptly follow.  

"Coming Off Psych Drugs” is a 75-minute documentary that glimpses into the world of coming off meds through the eyes of a group of people who have done it, are going through it, or have helped others through the process. The film presents Will Hall author of “Harm Reduction Guide to Coming Off Psychiatric Drugs” (published by The Icarus Project), Oryx Cohen, director at the National Empowerment Center, Laura Delano and others. 

This film is presently subtitled in five languages, the most recent of which is Spanish, a project of the Red Icaria—the Icarus Project in Spain. Daniel Mackler is the director of four alternative mental health documentaries, three of which have been subtitled in upwards of twenty languages. He is also the co-author of two books: “A Way Out of Madness: Dealing with Your Family After You Have Been Diagnosed with a Psychiatric Disorder” and “Beyond Medication: Therapeutic Engagement and the Recovery from Psychosis.” Daniel was also a psychotherapist in New York City for ten years, but quit six years ago so he could become himself—and hasn’t regretted it for a moment.

All NYC Icarus events try to create a space for [Mad Making](http://nycicarus.org/events/madmaking/) - where community members can self-organize their own peer-support groups.
