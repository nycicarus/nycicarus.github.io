### NYC Icarus - Film and Discussion: Daniel Mackler's "Take These Broken Wings"

#### Join us at Bluestockings June 1st, 7pm for a viewing and discussion of schizophrenia.

This month NYC Icarus will host a screening and  discussion about schizophrenia on June 1st at 7pm at the Bluestockings Bookstore and Activist Center.  A question and answer session will promptly follow.  

Take These Broken Wings, a feature-length documentary film by director and former psychotherapist Daniel Mackler, shows that people can recover fully from schizophrenia without psychiatric medication.  According to most of the mental health field, and of course the pharmaceutical industry, this is not possible.  The film centers on the lives of two women – heroes of mine – who both recovered from severe schizophrenia.  The film traces the roots of their schizophrenia to childhood trauma and details their successful psychotherapy with gifted clinicians.

All NYC Icarus events try to create a space for [Mad Making](http://nycicarus.org/events/madmaking/) - where community members can self-organize their own peer-support groups.
