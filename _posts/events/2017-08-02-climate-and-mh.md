#### With Dr. Erica Fletcher

How does ecological degradation affect our lives? How do we respond to the warming world around us? How might we all be shaped by environ(mental) loss on colonized lands? Join us at Bluestockings on Wednesday, August 2nd for a talk and film screening with Erica Fletcher, PhD, a social researcher and filmmaker. She will discuss landscapes of mental distress within her urban homeland of Houston, Texas and make connections between urban pollution and climate change, mutual aid and migration, and the limits of "resilience" in supporting environ(mental) diversity. 

We will also host a mini-open mic for 6-8 people to read poems, short stories, or personal essays about ways the environment affects your experiences of crisis and healing. The segment is limited to 8 min per person (max). If youâ€™d like to read something, please email nycicarus@gmail.com and let us know your name and what your piece will be about generally by Tuesday August 1st.

Event Schedule

7-8pm: Talk & Film Screening (12 min)

8-9:30pm: Open Mic Session
