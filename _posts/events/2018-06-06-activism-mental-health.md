#### Activism, movments and frameworks

Join the NYC Icarus project and have a conversation about the frameworks, activism and movements in mental health. 1 in 4 people is reported to deal with a mental health issue, or 40,000,000 Americans. 

Some are focused on single issues, others represent ways of being in the world and identity , and others still talk about how we heal. We will present about these and then invite our community to talk about them and where they see themselves in the conversation. 

Some of the topics that will be introduced will be: the medical model and biopsychitry, neurodiversity, the social model of disability, the C/S/X (psychiatric survivor/consumer/ex-patient) movement, anti-ECT, anti-med, anti-psychiatry movments, the Trauma model, the recovery model, the peer movement, the mad rights movement and healing justice. 

We can also bring our intersectional lens and ask how identity and privilege intersection with these. 

BRING YOUR ARTWORK, POEMS, MUSIC: We will have time to share any creations/expressions around oppression, identity, and madness.

#### TRANSPARENCY:
Though we are committed to collective liberation and are a mixed race collective, our history has traditionally brought in white, middle class people. In order to protect Queer Trans People of Color (QTPOC) from tokenization and psychic harm, we as a collective commit to prioritizing the needs of QTPOC in our public events and promoting QTPOC leadership in our collective. We acknowledge the emotional labor that QTPOC may perform in these spaces, which often go unrecognized. Therefore, we want white cisgender people to independently undo racism, gender binarism / sexism, while remaining accountable to QTPOC. We are currently engaging in an ongoing process of integrating these goals internally within our
organization, among our mixed race organizers, and within the structuring of our external events. *

#### ACCESS ISSUES: The space is accessible for wheelchair users but does not have a bathroom for wheelchair users. We use mics to support people who are hard of hearing.

One of the main facilitators has a service dog in training, please don't stare or pet the dog. 
Bluestockings is wheelchair accessible, with no steps or platforms, and wide aisles between shelves. Our bathroom is not wheelchair accessible. There is a Starbucks two short blocks down the street with an accessible bathroom (at Allen and Delancey). Metered street parking is readily available in the blocks surrounding Bluestockings. Bluestockings is not a scent-free space, but we encourage visitors to please refrain from wearing perfumes, colognes or other scented products (including essential oils) and smoke far away from the entrance to the space.

And then weâ€™ll hang out for a little while and be gone until another month.
