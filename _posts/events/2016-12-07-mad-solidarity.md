### Mad Solidarity in a World Gone Mad: Building Support and Empowerment after the Election

#### Join us at Bluestockings on December 7th, 7pm for a discussion about self-care and avoiding activist burnout after the election

# Mad Solidarity in a World Gone Mad: Building Support and Empowerment after the Election

The recent election results have been shocking and hard on many us. Join us for discussion, solidarity-building group activities, and resource sharing in support of surviving, coming together, and keeping up the fight in the aftermath of Trump’s unlikely win.

We will explore questions such as: How has the election affected us? What are our fears and what can we do to increase feelings of safety? What does support look like to us now and how do we support those around us? What can we do to feel empowered? How do we balance self care with staying up to date and taking direct action? Help us brainstorm what the radical mental health community can offer to the greater community at this time, as well as what we can do to fight for the rights of those in the mental health system at this time.

We will also celebrate each other through the holiday season, a season that stirs up many emotions and is often a time where many of us revisit complex family dynamics. You are not alone.
