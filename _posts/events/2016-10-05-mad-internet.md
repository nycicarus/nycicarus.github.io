### NYC Icarus - Caught in the Web: Mad Lives and the Internet

#### Join us at Bluestockings on October 5th, 7pm for a discussion of topics at the intersection of madness and information technology. 

# Caught in the Web: Mad Lives and the Internet
How can we as mad people navigate a relationship with the internet that maximizes its potential as a wellness tool while minimizing its more toxic and addictive aspects? What are the relevant concerns around privacy, safety, and authenticity when it comes to incorporating the internet into our communities and lives? What new avenues does the internet open up for mad activists? These and other topics will be explored in a group discussion, following the screening of excerpts from Werner Herzog’s new internet documentary “Lo and Behold: Reveries of the Connected World”. 

Icarista Jonah will also give a talk about online surveillance and "early intervention” for people with mental health issues, as well as the presidential candidates’ proposals around mental health policy. Hope to see you there!
