#### The Power of Love in the Face of Hate

Join us at Bluestockings on Wednesday, October 4th for a discussion about living in these precarious times

"When we are engaged in acts of love, we humans are at our best and most resilient. The love in romance that makes us want to be better people, the love of children that makes us change our whole lives to meet their needs, the love of family that makes us drop everything to take care of them, the love of community that makes us work tirelessly with broken hearts....what would our movements look like if we focused on critical connections instead of critical mass." – Adrienne Maree Brown “Emergent Strategy”

How do we build strong and loving community in times where our social and economic safety nets are literally being ripped out from under us by the ones with the political power?

How can we take care of ourselves enough that we have the energy to care for others, and how can we open up space in our hearts and minds to understand folks who are different than us?

What are ways we have been mentors and what are ways we have been mentored by others -- how do we build loving and creative mentorship structures in our movement?

This month at the NYC Icarus event we’re going to facilitate a conversation about all these topics and learn from each other, and have fun while we’re doing it!

The event will start at 7pm sharp. Bluestockings will humor us as we gather in a circle of chairs in the middle of the store. We will do a group reading of the meeting agreements and brief introductions.
Sascha will facilitate the conversation with the help of whoever feels inspired to help.
There will be time at the end for announcements of other local projects and events.
If there are folks interested in starting a local support group cell there will be time to meet and discuss.
And then we’ll hang out for a little while and be gone until another month.
Make sure to sign-up for the mailing list at the event or email nycicarus@gmail.com.
